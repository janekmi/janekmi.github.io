DESCRIPTION []()
----------------

**libpmemlog** provides a log file in *persistent memory* (pmem) such
that additions to the log are appended atomically. This library is
intended for applications using direct access storage (DAX), which is
storage that supports load/store access without paging blocks from a
block storage device. Some types of *non-volatile memory DIMMs*
(NVDIMMs) provide this type of byte addressable access to storage. A
*persistent memory aware file system* is typically used to expose the
direct access to applications. Memory mapping a file from this type of
file system results in the load/store, non-paged access to pmem.
**libpmemlog** builds on this type of memory mapped file.

This library is for applications that need a persistent log file,
updated atomically (the updates cannot be *torn* by program interruption
such as power failures). This library builds on the low-level pmem
support provided by **libpmem**(3)**,** handling the transactional
update of the log, flushing to persistence, and recovery for the
application.

**libpmemlog** is one of a collection of persistent memory libraries
available, the others are:

**libpmemobj**(3), a general use persistent memory API, providing memory
allocation and transactional operations on variable-sized objects.

**libpmemblk**(3), providing pmem-resident arrays of fixed-sized blocks
with atomic updates.

**libpmem**(3), low-level persistent memory support.

Under normal usage, **libpmemlog** will never print messages or
intentionally cause the process to exit. The only exception to this is
the debugging information, when enabled, as described under **DEBUGGING
AND ERROR HANDLING** below.

MOST COMMONLY USED FUNCTIONS []()
---------------------------------

To use the pmem-resident log file provided by **libpmemlog**, a *memory
pool* is first created. This is done with the **pmemlog\_create**()
function described in this section. The other functions described in
this section then operate on the resulting log memory pool.

Once created, the memory pool is represented by an opaque handle, of
type *PMEMlogpool \**, which is passed to most of the other functions in
this section. Internally, **libpmemlog** will use either
**pmem\_persist**() or **msync**(2) when it needs to flush changes,
depending on whether the memory pool appears to be persistent memory or
a regular file (see the **pmem\_is\_pmem**() function in **libpmem**(3)
for more information). There is no need for applications to flush
changes directly when using the log memory API provided by
**libpmemlog**.

**PMEMlogpool \*pmemlog\_open(const char \****path***);**

The **pmemlog\_open**() function opens an existing log memory pool,
returning a memory pool handle used with most of the functions in this
section. *path* must be an existing file containing a log memory pool as
created by **pmemlog\_create**(). The application must have permission
to open the file and memory map it with read/write permissions. If an
error prevents the pool from being opened, **pmemlog\_open**() returns
NULL and sets errno appropriately.

**PMEMlogpool \*pmemlog\_create(const char \****path***,\
size\_t** *poolsize***, mode\_t** *mode***);**

The **pmemlog\_create**() function creates a log memory pool with the
given total *poolsize*. Since the transactional nature of a log memory
pool requires some space overhead in the memory pool, the resulting
available log size is less than *poolsize*, and is made available to the
caller via the **pmemlog\_nbyte**() function described below. *path*
specifies the name of the memory pool file to be created. *mode*
specifies the permissions to use when creating the file as described by
**creat**(2). The memory pool file is fully allocated to the size
*poolsize* using **posix\_fallocate**(3). The caller may choose to take
responsibility for creating the memory pool file by creating it before
calling **pmemlog\_create**() and then specifying *poolsize* as zero. In
this case **pmemlog\_create**() will take the pool size from the size of
the existing file and will verify that the file appears to be empty by
searching for any non-zero data in the pool header at the beginning of
the file. The minimum file size allowed by the library for a log pool is
defined in **&lt;libpmemlog.h&gt;** as **PMEMLOG\_MIN\_POOL**.

Depending on the configuration of the system, the available space of
non-volatile memory space may be divided into multiple memory devices.
In such case, the maximum size of the pmemlog memory pool could be
limited by the capacity of a single memory device. The **libpmemlog**
allows building persistent memory resident log spanning multiple memory
devices by creation of persistent memory pools consisting of multiple
files, where each part of such a *pool set* may be stored on different
pmem-aware filesystem.

Creation of all the parts of the pool set can be done with the
**pmemlog\_create**() function. However, the recommended method for
creating pool sets is to do it by using the **pmempool**(1) utility.

When creating the pool set consisting of multiple files, the *path*
argument passed to **pmemlog\_create**() must point to the special *set*
file that defines the pool layout and the location of all the parts of
the pool set. The *poolsize* argument must be 0. The meaning of *layout*
and *mode* arguments doesn’t change, except that the same *mode* is used
for creation of all the parts of the pool set. If the error prevents any
of the pool set files from being created, **pmemlog\_create**() returns
NULL and sets errno appropriately.

When opening the pool set consisting of multiple files, the *path*
argument passed to **pmemlog\_open**() must not point to the pmemlog
memory pool file, but to the same *set* file that was used for the pool
set creation. If an error prevents any of the pool set files from being
opened, or if the actual size of any file does not match the
corresponding part size defined in *set* file **pmemlog\_open**()
returns NULL and sets errno appropriately.

The set file is a plain text file, which must start with the line
containing a *PMEMPOOLSET* string, followed by the specification of all
the pool parts in the next lines. For each part, the file size and the
absolute path must be provided. The minimum file size of each part of
the pool set is the same as the minimum size allowed for a log pool
consisting of one file. It is defined in **&lt;libpmemlog.h&gt;** as
**PMEMLOG\_MIN\_POOL**. Lines starting with "\#" character are ignored.

Here is the example "mylogpool.set" file:

PMEMPOOLSET\
100G /mountpoint0/myfile.part0\
200G /mountpoint1/myfile.part1\
400G /mountpoint2/myfile.part2

The files in the set may be created by running the following command:

pmempool create log --from-set=mylogpool.set

**void pmemlog\_close(PMEMlogpool \****plp***);**

The **pmemlog\_close**() function closes the memory pool indicated by
*plp* and deletes the memory pool handle. The log memory pool itself
lives on in the file that contains it and may be re-opened at a later
time using **pmemlog\_open**() as described above.

**size\_t pmemlog\_nbyte(PMEMlogpool \****plp***);**

The **pmemlog\_nbyte**() function returns the amount of usable space in
the log *plp*. This function may be used on a log to determine how much
usable space is available after **libpmemlog** has added its metadata to
the memory pool.

**int pmemlog\_append(PMEMlogpool \****plp***, const void \****buf***,
size\_t** *count***);**

The **pmemlog\_append**() function appends *count* bytes from *buf* to
the current write offset in the log memory pool *plp*. Calling this
function is analogous to appending to a file. The append is atomic and
cannot be torn by a program failure or system crash. On success, zero is
returned. On error, -1 is returned and errno is set.

**int pmemlog\_appendv(PMEMlogpool \****plp***,\
const struct iovec \****iov***, int** *iovcnt***);**

The **pmemlog\_appendv**() function appends to the log *plp* just like
**pmemlog\_append**() above, but this function takes a scatter/gather
list in a manner similar to **writev**(2). In this case, the entire list
of buffers is appended atomically, as if the buffers in *iov* were
concatenated in order. On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is
returned and errno is set.

NOTE: Since **libpmemlog** is designed as a low-latency code path, many
of the checks routinely done by the operating system for **writev**(2)
are not practical in the library’s implementation of
**pmemlog\_appendv**(). No attempt is made to detect NULL or incorrect
pointers, or illegal count values, for example.

**long long pmemlog\_tell(PMEMlogpool \****plp***);**

The **pmemlog\_tell**() function returns the current write point for the
log, expressed as a byte offset into the usable log space in the memory
pool. This offset starts off as zero on a newly-created log, and is
incremented by each successful append operation. This function can be
used to determine how much data is currently in the log.

**void pmemlog\_rewind(PMEMlogpool \****plp***);**

The **pmemlog\_rewind**() function resets the current write point for
the log to zero. After this call, the next append adds to the beginning
of the log.

**void pmemlog\_walk(PMEMlogpool \****plp***, size\_t chunksize ,\
int (\****process\_chunk***)(const void \****buf***, size\_t** *len***,
void \****arg***),\
void \****arg***);**

The **pmemlog\_walk**() function walks through the log *plp*, from
beginning to end, calling the callback function *process\_chunk* for
each *chunksize* block of data found. The argument *arg* is also passed
to the callback to help avoid the need for global state. The *chunksize*
argument is useful for logs with fixed-length records and may be
specified as 0 to cause a single call to the callback with the entire
log contents passed as the *buf* argument. The *len* argument tells the
*process\_chunk* function how much data buf is holding. The callback
function should return 1 if **pmemlog\_walk**() should continue walking
through the log, or 0 to terminate the walk. The callback function is
called while holding **libpmemlog** internal locks that make calls
atomic, so the callback function must not try to append to the log
itself or deadlock will occur.

LIBRARY API VERSIONING []()
---------------------------

This section describes how the library API is versioned, allowing
applications to work with an evolving API.

**const char \*pmemlog\_check\_version(\
unsigned** *major\_required***,\
unsigned** *minor\_required***);**

The **pmemlog\_check\_version**() function is used to see if the
installed **libpmemlog** supports the version of the library API
required by an application. The easiest way to do this is for the
application to supply the compile-time version information, supplied by
defines in **&lt;libpmemlog.h&gt;**, like this:

reason = pmemblk\_check\_version(PMEMLOG\_MAJOR\_VERSION,\
PMEMLOG\_MINOR\_VERSION);\
if (reason != NULL) {\
/\* version check failed, reason string tells you why \*/\
}

Any mismatch in the major version number is considered a failure, but a
library with a newer minor version number will pass this check since
increasing minor versions imply backwards compatibility.

An application can also check specifically for the existence of an
interface by checking for the version where that interface was
introduced. These versions are documented in this man page as follows:
unless otherwise specified, all interfaces described here are available
in version 1.0 of the library. Interfaces added after version 1.0 will
contain the text *introduced in version x.y* in the section of this
manual describing the feature.

When the version check performed by **pmemlog\_check\_version**() is
successful, the return value is NULL. Otherwise the return value is a
static string describing the reason for failing the version check. The
string returned by **pmemlog\_check\_version**() must not be modified or
freed.

MANAGING LIBRARY BEHAVIOR []()
------------------------------

The library entry points described in this section are less commonly
used than the previous sections.

**void pmemlog\_set\_funcs(\
void \*(\****malloc\_func***)(size\_t** *size***),\
void (\****free\_func***)(void \****ptr***),\
void \*(\****realloc\_func***)(void \****ptr***, size\_t** *size***),\
char \*(\****strdup\_func***)(const char \****s***));**

The **pmemlog\_set\_funcs**() function allows an application to override
memory allocation calls used internally by **libpmemlog**. Passing in
NULL for any of the handlers will cause the **libpmemlog** default
function to be used. The library does not make heavy use of the system
malloc functions, but it does allocate approximately 4-8 kilobytes for
each memory pool in use.

**int pmemlog\_check(const char \****path***);**

The **pmemlog\_check**() function performs a consistency check of the
file indicated by *path* and returns 1 if the memory pool is found to be
consistent. Any inconsistencies found will cause **pmemlog\_check**() to
return 0, in which case the use of the file with **libpmemlog** will
result in undefined behavior. The debug version of **libpmemlog** will
provide additional details on inconsistencies when
**PMEMLOG\_LOG\_LEVEL** is at least 1, as described in the **DEBUGGING
AND ERROR HANDLING** section below. **pmemlog\_check**() will return -1
and set errno if it cannot perform the consistency check due to other
errors. **pmemlog\_check**() opens the given *path* read-only so it
never makes any changes to the file.

DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING []()
---------------------------------

Two versions of **libpmemlog** are typically available on a development
system. The normal version, accessed when a program is linked using the
**-lpmemlog** option, is optimized for performance. That version skips
checks that impact performance and never logs any trace information or
performs any run-time assertions. If an error is detected during the
call to **libpmemlog** function, an application may retrieve an error
message describing the reason of failure using the following function:

**const char \*pmemlog\_errormsg(void);**

The **pmemlog\_errormsg**() function returns a pointer to a static
buffer containing the last error message logged for current thread. The
error message may include description of the corresponding error code
(if errno was set), as returned by **strerror**(3). The error message
buffer is thread-local; errors encountered in one thread do not affect
its value in other threads. The buffer is never cleared by any library
function; its content is significant only when the return value of the
immediately preceding call to **libpmemlog** function indicated an
error, or if errno was set. The application must not modify or free the
error message string, but it may be modified by subsequent calls to
other library functions.

A second version of **libpmemlog**, accessed when a program uses the
libraries under **/usr/lib/nvml\_debug**, contains run-time assertions
and trace points. The typical way to access the debug version is to set
the environment variable **LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH** to
**/usr/lib/nvml\_debug** or **/usr/lib64/nvml\_debug** depending on
where the debug libraries are installed on the system. The trace points
in the debug version of the library are enabled using the environment
variable **PMEMLOG\_LOG\_LEVEL**, which can be set to the following
values:

The environment variable **PMEMLOG\_LOG\_FILE** specifies a file name
where all logging information should be written. If the last character
in the name is "-", the PID of the current process will be appended to
the file name when the log file is created. If **PMEMLOG\_LOG\_FILE** is
not set, the logging output goes to stderr.

Setting the environment variable **PMEMLOG\_LOG\_LEVEL** has no effect
on the non-debug version of **libpmemlog**.

BUGS []()
---------

Unlike **libpmemobj**, data replication is not supported in
**libpmemlog**. Thus, it is not allowed to specify replica sections in
pool set files.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS []()
---------------------

**libpmemlog** builds on the persistent memory programming model
recommended by the SNIA NVM Programming Technical Work Group:
